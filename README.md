# Institutional_Bias_Dashboard
Reconstructing Institutional Bias Through a Data-Driven Visualization Dashboard

This is the repository of a thesis submitted in fulfillment of the requirements for the UU Master of Science degree in Applied Data Science. 

Abstract
In this thesis, we present an interactive data visualization dashboard developed to address the 2025 VAST Challenge Mini-Challenge 2, which focuses on analyzing stakeholder engagement and 
potential bias during meetings. The data visualizations created incorporate a matrix-based representation of the data alongside with bar plots, trend lines, boxplots, and tooltip details to create
a useful, interactive dashboard that allows any researcher to find out if there has been bias from the council members (COOTEFOO) or not. By analyzing the TROUT (tourism) and FILAH
(fishing) datasets, we reveal systematic sentiment divergences that align with each groupâ€™s interests, particularly when discussions concern their own industry sector (large vessels fishing or
tourism), providing evidence of bias within their respective records. Furthermore, incorporating the JOURNALIST dataset, which combines both perspectives, demonstrates that extreme sentiment
patterns moderate when a broader context is considered. Our final findings demonstrate that this thesis contributes a practical example of how interactive dashboards can support the detection
and contextualization of institutional bias, highlighting the value of a data-driven approach.
